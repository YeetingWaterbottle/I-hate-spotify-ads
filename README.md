<h1>if Your Spotify Installition is Different From The One in The Code, Please Change The Path. The Program is Still Not Finished.</h1>


I-hate-spotify-ads
A simple python program to auto restart spotify when an ad start playing.


<h1>Recomened one to download:</h1>
mininal.py or minimal + no_console.pyw

full.py is just random stuff that i thought was *~~"cool"~~*

<h2>my first ever python "project" also im not resonsible for anything. dont blame it on me thanks.</h2>



I dont think this is anything close to a efficient program, please make a pull request and make this piece of code better.
Also if there's any bugs that might occur, open an issue and maybe i'll check it
